== HEAD

* Add sorting for columns and indexes. (Helpful for out-of-order migration
  execution!)
* BugFix for models without tables.
* Annotate unit tests in subfolders.
* Add generator to install rakefile that automatically annotates on db:migrate.
* Fix gemspec generation now that Jeweler looks at Gemfile.
* Correct Gemfile to clarify which environments need which gems.
* Add an .rvmrc to facilitate clean development.
* Refactor out ActiveRecord monkey-patch to permit extending without
  side-effects.
* Use ObjectSpace to locate models to facilitate handling of models with
  non-standard capitalization.
  Note that this still requires that the inflector be configured to understand
  the special case.
* Merge away a few branches whose changes we already have in order to clean up
  the Github network graph.
* Fix warning: `NOTE: Gem::Specification#default_executable= is deprecated with
  no replacement. It will be removed on or after 2011-10-01.`
* Fix handling of files with no trailing newline when putting annotations at
  the end of the file.
* Accept String or Symbol for :position (et al) options.
* Rename "annotate" bin to "annotate_models" to avoid conflicting with
  ImageMagick.
